I am going to do this project with the help of eclipse and maven.
we will be maintaining the users information and using them for future purposes and login.
They will be asked for the input of the wastage. For that they will be getting the coupons and the coupon code for it.

They will login using their credentials, login security and the credentials protection is also provided for the security reasons.
